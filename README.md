# Emailbutton
Create email button as the user presses space bar and email is validated.
Although, the code is written just to meet the test requirements, I have added a disabled directive which can be used to further refine the app (like when multiple email adresses are entered, multiple instances of buttons are created created dynamically). 
Another directive can be used to remove the email buttons when respective glyphicon is clicked.
